        <p class="lead">
            For the past 8 months I have been working as an applied computing tutor at Sheridan College. Previous to
            this I
            have never worked in an industry that is relevant to my undergraduate degree. In these 8months I have grown
            both
            personally and professionally. I have set and completed many goals for myself and risen to the unique
            challenges
            that an online work environment can bring. I have a newfound and immense appreciation for the quick
            adaptations
            that post-secondary institutions have made during the Covid-19 pandemic. I am very proud to have been an
            important part of a team that works hard to nurture student success during my first work term as a co-op
            student. The independence I was given on-the-job allowed me to demonstrate initiative, leadership, and
            collaboration skills as well as learn new technical skills. Sheridan College's work environment made it easy
            for
            me to bring my own ideas forward to make my own work experience more unique, always with the ultimate goal
            of
            helping students. In this report I hope to teach you about Sheridan college, my duties while working there,
            my
            goals during this past work term, and the many things I have learned during this eight month experience.

        <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="about">About Sheridan</h1>
        <p class="fs-5">
            Sheridan college is a large post-secondary institution with 3 campuses. Their Davis campus in Brampton,
            Hazel McCallion campus in Mississauga, and Trafalgar campus in Oakville. Sheridan was founded in 1967 and
            educates
            thousands of students. They are known to have one of the best animation programs in the world. However,
            animation is not the only program that Sheridan offers. They have over 130 programs ranging across multiple
            subjects and disciplines. Sheridan offers courses in many areas of computing including object-oriented
            programming, algorithms, discrete math, and web development. Students are also exposed to many different
            programming languages and technologies including Java, C, Javascript, C#, and Java with Spring Boot. They
            have many programs related to computer science. There are programs in computer programming, mobile
            computing, internet communications technology, and software engineering just to name a few of them. As a
            tutor I interacted with students in many of these programs as well as professors for multiple different
            classes. With an average class size of approximately 35 people there are lots of class sections for a given
            course and also many different professors. These small class sizes make the projects and work that each
            section completes unique and tailored to the students in a particular class section.

        <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="job">Job Description</h1>
        <p class="fs-5">
            When I first applied to Sheridan college the Job title was “Java Learning assistant”, after I started
            working there the title was changed to :applied computing tutor” to reflect that the tutors heavily involved
            with first year Java courses were not limited to only tutoring students in these courses. As an applied
            computing tutor I could receive questions about anything ranging from making a graphical user interface in
            Java to basic search algorithms to boolean algebra.
            <br><br>
            As an applied computing tutor I tutored students taking Sheridan college’s PROG10082, PROG24178, and
            MATH18584 courses mainly. These courses covered an introduction to Object-oriented programming in Java,
            intermediate Object-oriented programming in Java, and computer math fundamentals respectively. During my
            first co-op term during the summer I was embedded in PROG24178 and during my second work term I was embedded
            in both PROG10082 and MATH18584. Being embedded in a course means that a tutor has full access to that
            class’ course website, announcements, and all course content that the professor posts. More importantly,
            tutors were responsible for hosting tutorial sessions for each of the class sections they were embedded in.
            These are hour-long group sessions that happen once per week. Students can come to tutorials with questions
            they have from class or their homework and tutors can give explanations and examples. Some students come to
            these sessions just looking for extra practice of course content and tutors are happy to help, making these
            sessions quite flexible. During my second 4-month term at Sheridan my colleagues and I created powerpoint
            presentations with examples and questions for students. This made the tutorial sessions very interactive
            even when students had few specific questions at the beginning of the sessions. This also allowed applied
            computing tutors to use the same examples across class sections. Students who couldn’t make it to their
            assigned tutorial hour were always welcome at other tutorials. During the summer term I was only embedded in
            4 class sections across 1 course. This means I hosted 4 tutorial sessions per week. One for each class
            section. However, in the fall term I was embedded in 11 class sections across 2 courses. I hosted 9 tutorial
            sessions per week because a few sections had their tutorials scheduled at the same time and thus were
            combined.
            <br><br>
            A “normal day at work” was not very common during my time at Sheridan college. My work schedule alternated
            between earlier and later shifts. On some days I would start work at 8:30 in the morning and other days I
            would start at noon and work later into the evening. I always had an hour-long lunch break but the timing
            would usually change day to day. Some days I would have lunch at noon and other days it would be 2:00PM.
            Tutors rotate between late and early shifts in order for Sheridan's tutoring centre to be open from 9:00AM
            to 8:00PM each day. This was a challenge for me at first because it made it quite difficult for me to
            establish a work routine. It was especially difficult working until 8:00PM one day and then starting at
            8:30AM the next day.
            <br><br>
            On days where I started at 8:30 in the morning I would always start my day with a half hour prep period.
            This time allowed me to see what concepts different class sections were being introduced to and what
            homework students were assigned. I was also able to see what appointments I had for the day and to do some
            research or reading to make sure I was prepared and my memory was refreshed about the subjects. Certain
            topics that students asked for help with such as finding the inverse of a matrix were topics that I had to
            review due to the time that had elapsed from when I learned about them. For matrices in particular it had
            been well over a year since I last used them in both MATH*1160 and CIS*2910 so I had to look at my notes and
            textbooks for some review before working with students on these concepts..
            <br><br>
            Other than tutorial sessions and prep periods I had appointment hours and drop-in hours every day. These
            hours would vary and some days would have much more drop-in time than appointment time on my schedule and
            every day the order these were held would change. Drop-in hours were times when I would be in a Webex call
            and students could join briefly to ask me quick questions and get clarification about concepts. Students
            would generally come to these sessions for about 10 or 15 minutes and did not have to book them in advance.
            These were basically the equivalent of teaching assistant office hours at the University of Guelph. I have
            previously mentioned appointments and these are relatively self-explanatory. They are one-on-one tutoring
            sessions with students that are either an hour or a half hour in length. These sessions are much more
            personal and the student and myself were able to focus on their needs specifically unlike a group session
            like a tutorial.
            <br><br>
            Students could book me through a website called TutorOcean where they could see my entire schedule for the
            whole semester. They used this to book appointments and tutorial sessions up to one week in advance.
            Students could also message me questions on this site and I would be able to promptly answer. TutorOcean is
            also where students went to join drop-in sessions and any special events that the applied computing tutors
            help. All of the sessions that I hosted were done through Webex and due to the online nature of Sheridan’s
            tutoring centre I was responsible for posting announcements periodically to the class sections I was
            embedded in to let them know where to find my schedule, availability, and how they could use TutorOcean to
            book and join sessions with myself or other tutors. After each session with a student I was responsible for
            entering basic attendance data into Microsoft Sharepoint.
            <br><br>
            In terms of special events, my colleagues and I held many“Exam Cram” sessions during both of my terms at
            Sheridan. These were group tutoring sessions where my colleagues and I would go over review questions with
            students before midterms and final exams. These were held for PROG10082 and PROG24178 and during my second
            term at Sheridan I took leadership and scheduled all of these sessions including which tutors would be
            present, what times the sessions would be held at, and whether my colleagues had any conflicts with these
            timings such as tutorials, and making sure announcements were posted to class sections advertising the Exam
            Crams. During my first and second terms at Sheridan I worked to edit, improve, and add to the bank of Java
            review questions found on Sheridan’s Learning and Teaching Environment (SLATE) website. These questions were
            relevant for PROG10082 and PROG24178 which cover topics such as basic Java programming and syntax,
            Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, class relationships, Abstract classes and interfaces, GUI
            programming, exception handling. Much of this knowledge I learned in CIS*2430 but I gained a much more
            in-depth understanding after reading a book called “Head First Java” recommended to the applied computing
            tutors during the summer term and teaching these concepts to students who are confused or struggling. I
            found that learning how to explain a concept in a way a student could understand gave me a much more
            in-depth understanding of the concept. The same was true for certain math concepts. However, for the
            computer math fundamentals class I encountered certain concepts that were completely new to me such as
            Karnaugh Maps. I learned these concepts on-the-job by looking at resources the professors posted to their
            class sections while I was not working with students.
            <br><br>
            The other most notable event during my term at Sheridan was the Java code refresh pilot project. This
            program allowed students who failed their first PROG10082 midterm to attend classes and review sessions
            during Sheridan’s reading week. During that week in the fall term I got to sit in on the review lectures
            hosted by professor Zaki Asmat and go over examples of the concepts reviewed by the professor such as
            primitive data types, order of operations, and formatted output afterwards in breakout rooms. 80 or more
            students attended these sessions and dozens attended extra review sessions at the end of the week. This
            pilot project was a big success and allowed students who might have failed the course a second chance at
            achieving a passing grade.
            <br><br>
            When working with students, communication skills were paramount. I have always had strong communication
            skills and these were refined both through reading, writing, and assignments involving presentations I have
            had in university and even more so through the 8 months I spent working at Sheridan. Even though almost all
            of my communication with students was verbal, written communication was also very important. Periodically, I
            would be assigned to write a report stating strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement during a given
            month or semester. These ranged from applied computing reports that just covered my department or combined
            reports that covered the entire tutoring center during the fall semester. I was also responsible for leading
            the september 2021 monthly report which included communicating with tutors from other departments.
            Communicating with colleagues to coordinate and plan events was also important and was something that
            improved as time went on. Collaboration with colleagues was also very important. I have worked in teams
            during previous employment when I worked at a restaurant so working together, asking for help, and giving
            feedback to teammates was something that I had previous experience with. At Sheridan the applied computing
            tutors would collaborate to plan events, work together on projects, and ensure students received the best
            help possible and I would frequently refer students to other tutors who were familiar with a concept I was
            not. For example, I am not familiar with the C# programming language so a student requesting help with this
            language would get referred by me to a tutor who is familiar with that language and can answer their
            question. However, I needed to make sure I was familiar with all the concepts introduced in classes I was
            embedded in. Quickly learning new things was very important and I learned new things constantly. I have
            always done well in school but on-the-job I found that I had to practice reflection every day and ask myself
            “Would I be able to explain this to a student?”. In University if I don’t fully grasp a concept I am the
            only one who will pay the consequences of receiving a poor grade but as a tutor I must keep in mind that a
            poor explanation from me could have negative consequences for the student requesting help. I also had to
            learn different tools and technologies used in various Java classes so that I could help students
            troubleshoot their problems. I learned how to use various IDEs such as netbeans and intelliJ and other tools
            such as JavaFX, notepad++ macros, some spring boot and thymeleaf.
            <br><br>
            The online environment was difficult for students and some got confused with the booking process through
            TutorOcean throughout the semester. Students not living in Canada often had issues with their time zone,
            thinking that my schedule was displaying in their local time when it was actually in eastern standard time.
            Some drop-in and appointment hours were unattended and sometimes students would not book the weekly tutorial
            meaning that it wouldn’t run. I had the opportunity to work on lots of different projects when I was not
            with students. I created 4 informational handouts for students during both of my work terms. One of these
            handouts was for PROG24178 students to review PROG10082 concepts at the beginning of the intermediate Java
            course, 2 were about JavaFX and FXML for PROG24178, and the final handout I created was for MATH18584 and
            was about the behaviour of common functions. I was able to work with professors to create these and received
            a lot of great feedback. My math handout was such a success that a math professor asked me if they could use
            it in their class sections and distribute it to students as an extra resource! I posted other handouts on
            Sheridan’s SLATE site so students would be able to get referred to them by tutors but I am very proud that
            the quality of my work was enough that a professor wanted to use it. I hope it benefits students for many
            semesters to come. One of the other notable projects that I worked on was research. During the summer term I
            was able to complete 2 Linkedin Learning courses covering an introduction to the Maven build system for Java
            and SpringBoot. During the more recent winter term my research shifted more to different teaching strategies
            and how students learn best and I read multiple scientific articles about these subjects.
            <br><br>
            As you can already tell by the volume of writing in this section, the breadth of my duties during my co-op
            work term was quite large and every day was different. I learned to really enjoy this, especially in a
            virtual work environment, because it kept every day exciting!

        <p class="fs-5">
            During my first work term, Sheridan College has greatly aided me in my professional development by providing
            me with the opportunities to take leadership and hone important skills like written and verbal communication
            skills. It has given me a unique online experience working with a team and with many students throughout the
            8 months I spent there. I also got to learn new technical skills and I know that the breadth of my duties
            and experience with Sheridan will make me a better educator in the future should I choose this career path.
            I am very proud of the work I have done during this work term and I will always remember the challenges,
            lessons, and experience that Sheridan gave me.
