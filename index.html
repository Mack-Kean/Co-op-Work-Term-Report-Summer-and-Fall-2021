            For the past 8 months I have been working as an applied computing tutor at Sheridan College. Previous to
            this I
            have never worked in an industry that is relevant to my undergraduate degree. In these 8months I have grown
            both
            personally and professionally. I have set and completed many goals for myself and risen to the unique
            challenges
            that an online work environment can bring. I have a newfound and immense appreciation for the quick
            adaptations
            that post-secondary institutions have made during the Covid-19 pandemic. I am very proud to have been an
            important part of a team that works hard to nurture student success during my first work term as a co-op
            student. The independence I was given on-the-job allowed me to demonstrate initiative, leadership, and
            collaboration skills as well as learn new technical skills. Sheridan College's work environment made it easy
            for
            me to bring my own ideas forward to make my own work experience more unique, always with the ultimate goal
            of
            helping students. In this report I hope to teach you about Sheridan college, my duties while working there,
            my
            goals during this past work term, and the many things I have learned during this eight month experience.

        <h1 class="display-4 mt-5" id="about">About Sheridan</h1>
        <p>
            Sheridan college is a large post-secondary institution with 3 campuses. Their Davis campus in Brampton,
            Hazel McCallion campus in Mississauga, and Trafalgar campus in Oakville. Sheridan was founded in 1967 and
            educates
            thousands of students. They are known to have one of the best animation programs in the world. However,
            animation is not the only program that Sheridan offers. They have over 130 programs ranging across multiple
            subjects and disciplines. Sheridan offers courses in many areas of computing including object-oriented
            programming, algorithms, discrete math, and web development. Students are also exposed to many different
            programming languages and technologies including Java, C, Javascript, C#, and Java with Spring Boot. They
            have many programs related to computer science. There are programs in computer programming, mobile
            computing, internet communications technology, and software engineering just to name a few of them. As a
            tutor I interacted with students in many of these programs as well as professors for multiple different
            classes. With an average class size of approximately 35 people there are lots of class sections for a given
            course and also many different professors. These small class sizes make the projects and work that each
            section completes unique and tailored to the students in a particular class section.
