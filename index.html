            For the past 8 months I have been working as an applied computing tutor at Sheridan College. Previous to
            this I
            have never worked in an industry that is relevant to my undergraduate degree. In these 8months I have grown
            both
            personally and professionally. I have set and completed many goals for myself and risen to the unique
            challenges
            that an online work environment can bring. I have a newfound and immense appreciation for the quick
            adaptations
            that post-secondary institutions have made during the Covid-19 pandemic. I am very proud to have been an
            important part of a team that works hard to nurture student success during my first work term as a co-op
            student. The independence I was given on-the-job allowed me to demonstrate initiative, leadership, and
            collaboration skills as well as learn new technical skills. Sheridan College's work environment made it easy
            for
            me to bring my own ideas forward to make my own work experience more unique, always with the ultimate goal
            of
            helping students. In this report I hope to teach you about Sheridan college, my duties while working there,
            my
            goals during this past work term, and the many things I have learned during this eight month experience.
